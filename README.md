# polys_Vanilla_Weapon_Expansion
A mod that adds new variants of the existing vanilla weapons.

Essentially, this mod just takes the weapons that are in the game and adds new variants by rechambering or reconfiguring them.

Currently included is;

- M14, essentially just taking the existing M21 SWS, removing the scope mount, making it select fire, and dropping the accuracy to around 2 MOA.
- Springfield M1A, essentially just the M14 but semi-auto only.
- M16A3, a copy of the M16A2 in safe/semi/auto instead of safe/semi/burst.
- XM-15 E2S Shorty, a semi-automatic M16A2 carbine for the civilian market.
- XM-15 E2S Target, a semi-automatic M16A2 for the civilian market.
- AF, a (cursed) select-fire prototype weapon derived from the SVD, chambered in 5.45x39mm.
- Tigr, essentially just the civilian version of the SVD. Accuracy is slightly lowered to reflect lower production quality.
- Tigr .308, just a Tigr in 7.62x51mm NATO.
- AP-67, a select-fire prototype rifle derived from the Sa vz. 58, chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO.
- EVR-76 Sporter, a semi-automatic Sa vz. 58V for the civilian market. Based off the CZH-2003 but as you can tell from the name, it wasn't invented yet, so I made a name up.

The 'civilian' weapons were added to the FIA arsenal, and the rest were put into their respective countries' arsenals.
